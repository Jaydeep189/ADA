To Run This code locally, you need to install GCC to complie C code, follow this blog for installation [blog by digital ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/c-compiler-windows-gcc)

cd into any of the practicals and run the following cmd

```
gcc -o app main.c library.c
```

```
app
```
